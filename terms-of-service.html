        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 6, 2026</p>
        
        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of ARBITER, a semantic coherence analysis platform operated by Actual General Intelligence ("AGI," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using ARBITER, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>ARBITER provides semantic coherence analysis only. We do not provide legal, medical, financial, military, or professional advice of any kind.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>ARBITER is a decision infrastructure platform that measures semantic coherence—the geometric relationships between concepts in high-dimensional semantic space. Our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzes constraint relationships and identifies coherent solution paths</li>
            <li>Provides quantitative coherence scores and comparative analysis</li>
            <li>Operates as a measurement and analysis tool only</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. No Professional Advice</h2>
        <div class="warning">
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> ARBITER does not provide and should not be construed as providing:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Advice:</strong> Coherence analysis of legal documents or strategies is not legal advice. Consult a licensed attorney for legal matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Advice:</strong> Analysis of medical protocols, drug pathways, or treatment options is not medical advice. Consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Advice:</strong> Analysis of investment strategies, M&A decisions, or financial instruments is not financial advice. Consult licensed financial advisors for financial decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Military or Defense Advice:</strong> Tactical or strategic analysis is provided as a decision-support tool only. All military and defense decisions remain the sole responsibility of qualified personnel and proper command authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Advice of Any Kind:</strong> ARBITER is an analytical tool. It does not replace professional judgment, expertise, or licensed practitioners in any field.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
